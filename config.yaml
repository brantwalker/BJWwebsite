    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/BJWheadshot_square.png"
    content: |-
      I am a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. 
      My background is in mathematics and economics, and I am passionate about using economic tools, including modeling and econometrics, to address real-world issues in our complex world.
      My work centers around energy & resource issues, specifically water & electricity markets.
      I also analyze the impact of public policy on human health.
      Currently, I work with Prof. Frank Wolak at the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development.
      
      Outside of work, I love to read & listen to audiobooks on my daily bike ride (find me on Goodreads: brant-walker). 
      I play ice hockey & football (soccer) about once a week, and play some bad chess for fun (Lichess: ecokingsman).
      I get out on the trails when I can - the small town Iowa boy cannot stray too far from nature.
      Oh, I started long-distance running: my first half-marathon was the 2021 Golden Gate Half & I plan on running the 2022 Toronto Marathon in May!
      And finally, you can always shock and awe me with a cool fact about the oceans (sharks are insane!) and space.
      If I chose a different career path, I would be a) building deep-sea observation subs b) building/trying to sneak my way onto a spaceship, or c) baling hay.
